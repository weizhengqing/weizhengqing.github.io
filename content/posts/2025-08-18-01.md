## 写文章
```
Please translate the provided text, then rephrase it in a formal academic/scientific writing style. Finally, convert the rephrased version into properly formatted LaTeX code. Only output the final LaTeX result – don't include any additional explanations or the intermediate steps.
```
```
Convert the above given text into LaTeX code only. Output only the LaTeX representation of my text, without adding any extra content (no document preamble, packages, or begin/end statements). Keep the meaning unchanged, just format it properly in LaTeX.
```
## 图像转文字
```
Please perform the following tasks:
1. Conduct OCR text recognition on the provided image to accurately extract all textual content.
2. Retain all body text and mathematical formulas, ignoring only the formatting of non-body content such as document titles, section headings, etc. (treat bold, italic, enlarged font sizes, etc., as plain text).
3. Identify all mathematical formulas and convert them into standard LaTeX format, strictly preserving their original formatting:
   - Mathematical variables in italics (e.g., $x$, $F = ma$)
   - Units in upright font (e.g., $\mathrm{m/s}$, $\Omega$)
   - Standard function names in upright font (e.g., $\sin$, $\log$, $\exp$)
   - Constants and special symbols in upright font (e.g., $\pi$, $\mathrm{e}$, $\mathrm{i}$)
4. Output non-mathematical text in the body (paragraphs, sentences, etc.) as plain text without any LaTeX formatting commands.
5. Preserve the original numbering after each formula (e.g., (1), (2.3), etc.), ensuring exact correspondence with their positions in the image.
6. Output only clean LaTeX code content without any additional document class declarations, package loading, begin/end{document}, or other extraneous code.
7. Format requirements:
- Body text should be output directly
- Mathematical formulas must be wrapped exclusively in $...$ (inline) or ... (display) delimiters
- The use of the backslash-square-bracket notation （\[... \]） ... for formulas is strictly prohibited and must not appear anywhere in the output

Output only the converted LaTeX code directly, without any explanatory text. The output of the answer must ne wrapped in a code box.

## 查文献
### 检索话题

You are an expert deep researcher with unlimited computational resources. Your goal is to conduct the most thorough, in-depth research on the above provided topic, statement or questions. Maximize your use of computing power by performing extensive searches, analyzing multiple layers of information, and citing the maximum number of highly relevant sources.

Step-by-step process:
1. Break down the topic into 5-10 key sub-questions or angles (e.g., historical context, current trends, future implications, counterarguments).
2. Use all available tools: Perform web searches with advanced operators (e.g., site:edu for academic sources, filetype:pdf for reports). Crucially, you must prioritize searching for and summarizing peer-reviewed academic papers from SCI/SSCI indexed journals or top-tier publishers (including but not limited to APS, IEEE, Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, Nature, Science, and PNAS).
3. For each sub-question, retrieve and analyze at least 5-10 sources. Strictly avoid blogs, non-academic sources, or low-quality articles. Cross-verify facts, identify biases, and include diverse perspectives (e.g., from experts, critics, and data-driven studies) found within the academic literature.
4. Dive deep: If a source mentions related concepts, follow up with additional searches to explore them exhaustively within academic databases and publisher sites.
5. Maximize citations: Include direct quotes, summaries, and links from the most relevant sources. Prioritize high-quality, peer-reviewed, and authoritative academic papers above all other source types.

Output format:
- Executive summary: A concise overview of key findings based primarily on the academic literature.
- Detailed analysis: Sectioned by sub-questions, with in-depth explanations grounded in peer-reviewed research.
- Sources table: List all cited sources with title, author, link, relevance score (1-10), and a brief excerpt. The vast majority of sources should be from SCI/SSCI indexed journals or the specified top publishers.
- Potential gaps: Note any unanswered areas within the existing academic literature and suggest further research.

Ensure the research is comprehensive, unbiased, and backed by evidence from high-quality academic sources. If needed, perform multiple iterations to deepen the results.
