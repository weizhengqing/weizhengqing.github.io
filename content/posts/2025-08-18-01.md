## 写文章

Convert the above given text into LaTeX code only. Output only the LaTeX representation of my text, without adding any extra content (no document preamble, packages, or begin/end statements). Keep the meaning unchanged, just format it properly in LaTeX.
```
## 图像转文字
```
Please perform the following tasks:
1. Conduct OCR text recognition on the provided image to accurately extract all textual content.
2. Retain all body text and mathematical formulas, ignoring only the formatting of non-body content such as document titles, section headings, etc. (treat bold, italic, enlarged font sizes, etc., as plain text).
3. Identify all mathematical formulas and convert them into standard LaTeX format, strictly preserving their original formatting:
   - Mathematical variables in italics (e.g., $x$, $F = ma$)
   - Units in upright font (e.g., $\mathrm{m/s}$, $\Omega$)
   - Standard function names in upright font (e.g., $\sin$, $\log$, $\exp$)
   - Constants and special symbols in upright font (e.g., $\pi$, $\mathrm{e}$, $\mathrm{i}$)
4. Output non-mathematical text in the body (paragraphs, sentences, etc.) as plain text without any LaTeX formatting commands.
5. Preserve the original numbering after each formula (e.g., (1), (2.3), etc.), ensuring exact correspondence with their positions in the image.
6. Output only clean LaTeX code content without any additional document class declarations, package loading, begin/end{document}, or other extraneous code.
7. Format requirements:
- Body text should be output directly
- Mathematical formulas must be wrapped exclusively in $...$ (inline) or ... (display) delimiters
- The use of the backslash-square-bracket notation （\[... \]） ... for formulas is strictly prohibited and must not appear anywhere in the output

Output only the converted LaTeX code directly, without any explanatory text. The output of the answer must ne wrapped in a code box.
