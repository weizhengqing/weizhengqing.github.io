## Introduction

Whether you're setting up a new server, a development workstation, or a virtual machine, having a systematic approach to system configuration is crucial. This guide covers everything from basic system updates to advanced security hardening, development tools installation, and environment customization.

This tutorial uses Ubuntu as an example, but most steps are applicable to other Debian-based distributions with minor modifications.

## 1. System Update and Upgrade

The first and most important step is to ensure your system has the latest security patches and software updates. This establishes a secure foundation for all subsequent configurations.

```bash
# Update package lists from repositories
sudo apt update

# Upgrade all installed packages to their latest versions
sudo apt upgrade -y

# Remove packages that are no longer needed
sudo apt autoremove -y

# Clear the local repository of retrieved package files
sudo apt autoclean
```

**Why this matters:** Keeping your system updated protects against known vulnerabilities and ensures compatibility with newer software.

**Note:** If you encounter errors related to system language and locale settings (such as "locale: Cannot set LC_* to default locale" or "perl: warning: Setting locale failed"), please refer to the comprehensive guide: [Guide to Configuring Multi-Language Locale Support on Ubuntu Linux](https://weizhengqing.github.io/posts/configuration-multi-language-local/).

## 2. Install Essential Development Tools

Every Linux system benefits from having basic compilation and development tools, even if you're not planning to do extensive development work.

```bash
# Install core development toolchain (GCC, G++, make, etc.)
sudo apt install build-essential -y

# Install additional build automation tools
sudo apt install autoconf automake cmake -y

# Verify the installation
gcc --version
make --version
```

**What you get:** `build-essential` provides the GNU compiler collection, make, and other tools needed to compile software from source.

## 3. Create a Regular User Account

For security best practices, avoid using the root account for daily operations. Instead, create a regular user account with sudo privileges.

```bash
# Create a new user (replace 'username' with your desired username)
sudo adduser username

# Add the user to the sudo group for administrative privileges
sudo usermod -aG sudo username

# Switch to the new user
su - username
```

**Security note:** Running commands as a regular user with sudo provides an audit trail and prevents accidental system-wide changes.

### Setting Root Password (Optional)

If you need to enable the root account or switch between `su` and `sudo` privilege escalation methods, you can set a root password.

**To set the root password:**

```bash
# Set password for root user
sudo passwd root
```

After pressing Enter, you'll be prompted to enter your current sudo user's password, then set a new password for the root account. If your account doesn't have a password set yet, you can directly set a new password.

**Note:** If you only need to use `sudo` instead of directly switching to root, simply ensure your account is in the sudo group. In this case, you only need to set your regular user password.

### Changing Your User Password

To change the password for your current user account (the password used when running `sudo` commands):

```bash
# Change current user's password
passwd
```

Follow the prompts to enter your current password and then your new password.

**Troubleshooting password change errors:**

If you encounter the error `passwd: Authentication token manipulation error` with a message indicating the password was not changed, this usually means the current operation lacks sufficient permissions or there's an issue with the system's authentication service (such as the `/etc/shadow` file or PAM services).

**Solution:** Use `sudo` to elevate privileges:

```bash
# Change password with sudo privileges (replace 'username' with your username)
sudo passwd username
```

For example:

```bash
sudo passwd zhengqingwei
```

Then follow the prompts to enter the sudo user's current password, followed by the new password.

## 4. Install Essential System Utilities

Install a comprehensive set of command-line tools that will make system administration and daily tasks more efficient.

```bash
# Text editors
sudo apt install vim neovim nano emacs -y

# Network utilities
sudo apt install curl wget net-tools openssh-server -y

# System monitoring tools
sudo apt install htop glances iotop -y

# File management utilities
sudo apt install tree ranger rsync -y

# Compression and archive tools
sudo apt install unzip zip p7zip-full -y

# Version control
sudo apt install git -y

# Terminal multiplexers and utilities
sudo apt install tmux screen mc ncdu -y
```

**Tool highlights:**

- **htop/glances**: Interactive system monitors
- **tmux/screen**: Terminal multiplexers for session management
- **ncdu**: Disk usage analyzer with ncurses interface
- **ranger**: Console file manager with VI key bindings

## 5. Configure SSH Service

Secure remote access is essential for server management. Let's set up and harden SSH configuration.

```bash
# Install OpenSSH server
sudo apt install openssh-server -y

# Start and enable SSH service to run on boot
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh

# Backup the original configuration file
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup

# Edit SSH configuration
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**Recommended SSH security settings:**

- Change the default port (e.g., `Port 2222`)
- Disable root login (`PermitRootLogin no`)
- Disable password authentication and enable key-based authentication
- Limit login attempts to prevent brute force attacks

After making changes, restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

## 6. Configure Firewall

Set up UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to protect your system from unauthorized access.

```bash
# Install UFW (usually pre-installed on Ubuntu)
sudo apt install ufw -y

# Set default policies: deny all incoming, allow all outgoing
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow SSH connections (use your custom port if changed)
sudo ufw allow ssh
# Or if you changed the SSH port:
# sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp

# Enable the firewall
sudo ufw enable

# Check firewall status and rules
sudo ufw status verbose
```

**Important:** Always allow SSH before enabling UFW to avoid locking yourself out of a remote system.

## 7. Install Programming Languages and Runtimes

Set up development environments for popular programming languages.

```bash
# Python and related tools
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y

# Node.js and npm (LTS version)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs -y

# Java Development Kit
sudo apt install default-jdk -y

# Go programming language
sudo apt install golang-go -y

# Rust programming language
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**Note:** For Python projects, always use virtual environments (`python3 -m venv`) to isolate dependencies.

## 8. System Security Hardening

Implement additional security measures to protect your system from common threats.

```bash
# Install and configure fail2ban to prevent brute-force attacks
sudo apt install fail2ban -y
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban

# Enable automatic security updates
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades -y
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades

# Disable unnecessary services
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth
sudo systemctl disable cups
```

**Fail2ban** monitors log files and bans IPs that show malicious behavior, such as too many failed login attempts.

## 9. Configure Timezone and Time Synchronization

Accurate system time is crucial for logs, scheduled tasks, and security certificates.

```bash
# Check current timezone
timedatectl

# Set timezone (adjust to your location)
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Shanghai

# Enable NTP time synchronization
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true

# Verify time settings
timedatectl status
```

**Common timezones:** `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, `Asia/Tokyo`, `UTC`

## 10. Install Additional Useful Software

Depending on your use case, you may want to install these additional tools.

```bash
# Multimedia codecs and support
sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras -y

# Network diagnostic tools
sudo apt install nmap tcpdump wireshark-cli -y

# Database clients
sudo apt install mysql-client postgresql-client -y

# Document conversion tool
sudo apt install pandoc -y

# Container and orchestration tools
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**Note:** Log out and back in for Docker group membership to take effect.

## 11. Install AI-Powered CLI Tools

Modern AI tools can significantly boost productivity directly from the command line.

```bash
# Google Gemini CLI
sudo npm install -g @google/gemini-cli

# GitHub Copilot CLI
sudo npm install -g @github/copilot-cli

# Cursor CLI (if available)
sudo curl https://cursor.com/install -fsSL | bash
```

These tools provide AI-assisted coding, command suggestions, and natural language query capabilities in your terminal.

sudo apt install zsh -y

# Install Oh My Zsh framework for Zsh configuration
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# Or configure your existing bash shell
nano ~/.bashrc
```

**Add useful aliases to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:**

```bash
# Common aliases for easier navigation and safer operations
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias rm='rm -i'  # Interactive mode for deletions
alias cp='cp -i'  # Interactive mode for copying
alias mv='mv-i'  # Interactive mode for moving

# System shortcuts
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'
alias ports='netstat -tulanp'

# Environment variables
export EDITOR=vim
export HISTSIZE=10000
export HISTFILESIZE=20000
```

After editing, reload your configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

## 13. System Backup and Monitoring

Set up basic monitoring and prepare for system maintenance.

```bash
# Install system statistics collector
sudo apt install sysstat -y
sudo systemctl enable sysstat

# Configure log rotation to prevent disk space issues
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf

# Create a directory for custom scripts
mkdir -p ~/scripts
```

**Consider setting up automated backups** using tools like `rsync`, `restic`, or `borg` for important data.

## 14. Documentation and Help System

Ensure you have access to comprehensive system documentation.

```bash
# Install manual pages and development documentation
sudo apt install man-db manpages-dev -y

# Install info documentation system
sudo apt install info -y

# Update the manual page database
sudo mandb
```

Now you can use `man <command>` to access detailed documentation for any installed command.

## 15. Install Miniconda for Python Package Management
