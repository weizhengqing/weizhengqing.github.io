Crystal structure modeling is a fundamental skill in materials science and computational chemistry. VESTA (Visualization for Electronic and STructural Analysis) is a powerful, user-friendly software tool that enables researchers to create, visualize, and manipulate crystal structures with ease. This guide demonstrates how to build a face-centered cubic (FCC) aluminum structure from scratch using VESTA.

## Building Crystal Structures with VESTA

VESTA provides an intuitive interface for creating crystal structures by specifying lattice parameters, space groups, and atomic positions. Let's walk through the process of manually constructing an FCC aluminum crystal structure.

### Creating an FCC Aluminum Structure

Follow these steps to create an FCC aluminum bulk structure in VESTA:

1. **Initialize a new structure**: Navigate to `File → New Structure` to open the structure creation dialog.

2. **Define the unit cell**: In the `Unit Cell` tab, configure the following parameters:
   - Set the lattice constants `a`, `b`, and `c` to **4.05 Å**
   - Select **Cubic** for the crystal system
   - Choose space group **No. 225 (Fm-3m)**, which corresponds to the FCC structure

3. **Add aluminum atoms**: In the `Structure Parameters` section:
   - Click the **New** button to create a new atom
   - Set the **Symbol** to `Al`
   - Enter `Al1` as the **Label**
   - Confirm the settings to generate the FCC aluminum bulk structure

4. **Prepare for export**: Before exporting to `.xyz` or `.vasp` format, it's important to **trim edge atoms** along all three crystallographic directions (a, b, and c) and save the work in VESTA's native format (`.vesta`). And  This ensures clean periodic boundary conditions and prevents artifacts in subsequent calculations.
