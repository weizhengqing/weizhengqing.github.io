Welcome to my digital notebook! I'm a computational materials scientist exploring the fascinating world of materials through simulations and modeling. This blog serves as a collection of my research notes, technical guides, and insights into materials science, quantum mechanics, and scientific computing.

Here you'll find tutorials on DFT calculations, system setup guides, and explorations of various computational tools. Whether you're a fellow researcher or just curious about materials science, I hope you find something useful here.
